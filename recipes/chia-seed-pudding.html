        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It’s 3:00pm and you’re feeling drenched from the day. But you know the hard part of the day (especially if you have kids) ain’t over yet. This is when you reach for that <strong>pick-me-up snack</strong>. I want you to add one more healthy, easy and filling snack to that line-up: chia pudding! I make my chia pudding with only 3 ingredients: chia seeds, milk and a sweetener of choice.</p>

        <p>When it settles in the fridge, it has a pudding texture, amazing flavor and lends itself to endless topping possibilities. It’s a snack will leave you feeling <strong>satiated and so energized</strong> for your day!</p>

            <li>When you’re ready to eat it, top with your favorite fruit and enjoy cold!</li>
